# FYI; For Your Information

This project enables intuitive searching of local files and documentation using natural language queries. Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), it interprets human-written queries and locates relevant files and content efficiently. Under the hood, a vector store is used to enhance search accuracy and performance.

## Features

- **Natural Language Search:** Find files and documentation using queries written in plain English.
- **LLM-Powered Interpretation:** Queries are interpreted by an LLM for better understanding and relevance.
- **Vector Store Backend:** Fast and accurate search results using vector embeddings.
- **Local File Support:** Works with files stored on your local machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the application and start searching your local files with natural language queries.

## Usage
