<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.</p>
<p>It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data.</p>
<p>The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where explicit programming is infeasible.</p>
<p>Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics.</p>
<p>Machine learning has applications in email filtering, network intrusion detection, and computer vision.</p>
<p>Machine learning is used in self-driving cars, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Machine learning is categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models.</p>
<p>Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns.</p>
