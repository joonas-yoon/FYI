<h1>Deep Learning</h1>
<p>Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.</p>
<p>Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>
<p>Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs.</p>
<p>Deep learning models are trained by using large amounts of data and neural network architectures that learn features directly from data.</p>
<p>Deep learning has enabled many practical applications of machine learning and by extension the overall field of AI.</p>
<p>Deep learning requires substantial computational resources.</p>
<p>Deep learning is used in autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and more.</p>
<p>Deep learning models can outperform traditional machine learning models in many tasks.</p>
<p>Deep learning is a rapidly evolving field.</p>
<p>Deep learning research is advancing the state of the art in AI.</p>
