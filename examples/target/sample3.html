<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.</p>
<p>Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents".</p>
<p>AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems.</p>
<p>As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI.</p>
<p>AI research has been divided into subfields that focus on specific problems or approaches.</p>
<p>Subfields include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.</p>
<p>General intelligence is still among the field's long-term goals.</p>
<p>AI is founded on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized.</p>
<p>AI has become an essential part of the technology industry.</p>
<p>AI is used in healthcare, finance, robotics, and more.</p>
